This system is proposed to be an automated system that stores the number of plates of food (chaat) items sold every day and the revenue generated by selling those food items. Total cost of the food items is stored on daily basis and helps in calculation and management of daily expenses. The profit or loss calculation can also be done on daily basis. This system provides data storing & report generation with graphical user interface (GUI).
It is always necessary to study and recognize the problems of existing system, which will help in finding out the requirements for the new system. System study helps in finding different alternatives for better solution. The project study basically deals with different operations and steps involved in generation of examination mark sheets. It includes:
1. Data gathering
2. Study of existing system
3. Analyzing problem
4. Studying various documents
5. Feasibility study for further improvements
Following are the steps taken during the initial study:
Initially, we collected all the information, which they wanted to store. Then we studied the working of the current system which is done manually. We noted the limitation of that system which motivated them to have new system. With the help of these documents we got basic ideas about the system as well as input output of the developed system. The most important thing is to study system thoroughly. Here we are studying both existing system and proposed system so that advantages & disadvantages of both the systems can be Understood The first task was identifying how system can be computerized. Some analysis and projections was done regarding changes to be made to the existing system. The new developed system for Expense Management is simple without complexities.
